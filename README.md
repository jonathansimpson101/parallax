The aim of this mini project was to see if I could implement a parallax scrolling effect that I saw
in an online tutorial.

The trick is to use: background-attachment: fixed;

Not much else to report on this one> I didn't spend much time making it particularly responsive etc
because I want to focus on learning new things today.

Note: Parallax effect should be turned off for mobile devices.
